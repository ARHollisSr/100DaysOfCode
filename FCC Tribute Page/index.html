      <h3 id="headline">A condensed history of the Sega Genesis</h3>
      <li><strong>1980s</strong> - Sega Enterprises, a subsidary of Gulf and Western were in the top five of arcade manufacutures in the United States.</li>
      <li><strong>1983</strong> - Sega's first video home system the SG-100 was released but unsuccessful and replaced by the Sega Mark III within two years.</li>
      <li><strong>1986</strong> - Sega redesigned the Mark III for release in North America as the Sega Master System. The system enjoyed a successful European launch but lacked interest in Japan and North America.</li>
      <li><strong>1987</strong> - Sega faced a threat to their console business when NEC a Japanese company released the PC Engine. This motivated Sega to develop and incorporate a 16-bit microprocessor into its consoles.</li>
      <li><strong>1988</strong> - Beep magazine annouced the console that was in development by Sega known as the Mark V. However, the name was changed to Mega Drive for the Japanese market and to Genesis for the North American market; a possible result of a trademark dispute. Sega also released the Mega Drive in October of 1988 but it was over shadowed by Nintendo's release of Super Mario Bros 3.</li>
      <li><strong>1989</strong> - Sega released the Genesis in North America and offered the rights to Atari of whom didn't have a 16-bit system of their own. This was due to Sega not having a North Anerican partner to market the Gensis system. Atari subsequently declined as they wanted to focus on their Atari ST. As a result, Sega ended up launching the Gensis through its own Sega of America Subsidary.</li>

<div id="additionalInfo"><p>Some of the notable games that helped with the early success of the Genesis launch were John Madden Football - EA Sports and Sonic.</p>
<p> Sega was able to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row due Genesis's head start, lower price point, and a larger libray of games when compared to the Super Nintendo at it's release.</p>

<p>Sega's adverstising positioned the Genesis as the cooler console. As the marketing and advertsing evolved, the term "blast processing" was coined to suggest that the processing capabilities of the Genesis were far greater than that of the SNES.</p></div>
